###I received the following error: (webscrapers) C:\Users\Nadia Stoyanova>conda install -c conda-forge BeautifulSoup Channels:

conda-forge
defaults Platform: win-64 Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done Solving environment: failed
PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

beautifulsoup
Current channels:

https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
defaults
To search for alternate channels that may provide the conda package you're looking for, navigate to
https://anaconda.org
and use the search bar at the top of the page.

The error message indicates that the package BeautifulSoup cannot be found in the conda channels you are using. The correct package name for BeautifulSoup in conda is beautifulsoup4, not BeautifulSoup.

You can install it using the following command:

```conda install -c conda-forge beautifulsoup4```

This command tells conda to install the beautifulsoup4 package from the conda-forge channel.

You can install PyTorch using pip or conda. Here's how you can do it:

Using pip: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

Using conda: conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch

These commands will install PyTorch along with torchvision (a package with popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision) and torchaudio (similar to torchvision, but for audio).

Remember to activate your virtual environment before installing, if you're using one. 
Also, ensure that your Python and pip versions are up-to-date.
# All requested packages already installed.
